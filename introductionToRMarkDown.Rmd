# YAML header

### The YAML header is written just above this line

and output can be:- output: pdf_document output: html_document This code can only be run when we use three - with open and close

# Date

### We can use dynamic date in R mark Down

date: "Last edited`r format(Sys.time, '%d %B, %Y')`"

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

CTRL + SHIFT + K is used to Knit the file

To give heading we can use hash \# Like this:-

# Heading1

## Heading2

### Heading3

To write code we can write like this:- `code`

To bold the text, we can write like this:- **Bold** or **bold**

To italics the text we can write like this:- *italics* or *italics*

To strike through the text we can write like this:- ~~Hello~~

R code can be written here:-

```{r}
a <- 3+4
a
# this is a comment and this is a code chunk
```
