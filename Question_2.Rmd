# Highschool Senior Citizens

## The National Center of Education Statistics conducted a survey of high school seniors, collecting test data on reading, writing, and several other subjects. Here we examine a simple random sample of 200 students from this survey. Side-by-side box plots of reading and writing scores as well as a histogram of the differences in scores are shown below. Also provided below is a histogram of randomized averages of paired differences of scores (read - write), with the observed difference (x bar read-write=-0.545) marked with a red vertical line. The randomization distribution was produced by doing the following 1000 times: for each student, the two scores were randomly assigned to either read or write, and the average was taken across all students in the sample.

### a. Is there a clear difference in the average reading and writing scores?

### b. Are the reading and writing scores of each student independent of each other?

### c. Create hypotheses appropriate for the following research question: is there an evident difference in the average scores of students in the reading and writing exam?

### d. Is the average of the observed difference in scores (xbar read-write=-0.545) consistent with the distribution of randomized average differences? Explain.

### e. Do these data provide convincing evidence of a difference between the average scores on the two exams? Estimate the p-value from the randomization test, and conclude the hypothesis test using words like “score on reading test” and “score on writing test.”
